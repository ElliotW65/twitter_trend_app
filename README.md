This application displays an integrated map where the user can move a pin around the map, click on the pin and the top 5 twitter trends from within a 1 mile radius will be displayed. This data is drawn from the Twitter API when the user clicks on the pin using the coordinate data of the pin on the map.

This application is not hosted online but can be run by cloning the repo, running app.js with Node and navigating to "http://localhost:3000" in a browser.
